Carry on my wayward son,
There'll be peace when you are done.
Lay your weary head to rest,
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion,
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher,
But I flew too high.

Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man.
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man.
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming.
I can hear them say...

[Chorus:]
Carry on my wayward son,
There'll be peace when you are done.
Lay your weary head to rest,
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

[Chorus:]
Carry on my wayward son,
There'll be peace when you are done.
Lay your weary head to rest,
Don't you cry no more

No!

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
The center lights around your vanity
But surely heaven waits for you

[Chorus:]
Carry on my wayward son,
There'll be peace when you are done.
Lay your weary head to rest,
Don't you cry
Don't you cry no more

No more
